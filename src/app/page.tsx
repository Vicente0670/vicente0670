      <p>Some text to see. I can&apos;t see. This is part of some longer text to see! Now I can see. Actually, no I can&apos;t. I lied, so how does that make you as the user feel about the current situation that we are all in? After all, it&apos;s not my fault that you had to be able to make sure that you are here and are paying attention to all that I am yapping about, right? You need to make sure that you can stay focused on the types of things that people say about you and others, becuase then you cannot listen and lose track of words, especially crucial ones, that are made to be listened to and commented about, so that you can create feedback about the elements of the world.</p>
